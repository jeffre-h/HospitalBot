# HospitalBot

## Inspiration 
This project was created to combat the emergency healthcare crisis currently happening in Vancouver, B.C. Ever since the 2021 Covid-19 pandemic, there has been an emergency staff shortage affecting the Lower Mainland. In addition, the rise of the record-breaking heatwave in the summer of 2021 left thousands of patients with acute symptoms with no ambulance or emergency service to turn to. This amassed more than 600 deaths, which is a dangerous amount for a well developed country like Canada. Therefore, this healthcare project was created, not only to help patients reach emergency services faster, but also to relieve the stress for all emergency staff.
